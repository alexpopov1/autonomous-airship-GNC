# Autonomous Airship Design - Flight Dynamics and GNC Design
This repository contains my contributions towards the design of an autonomous airship, as part of the flight dynamics and control team (4 people) within a group of 25. The overall design is described in the *[Executive Summary](https://github.com/alexpopov1/autonomous-airship-GNC/blob/main/Autonomous%20Airship%20Executive%20Summary.pdf)*, featuring contributions from the entire group. My work within the project is detailed in my *[Individual Report](https://github.com/alexpopov1/autonomous-airship-GNC/blob/main/GDP%20Individual%20Report.pdf)*, and the simulated GNC system in action can be seen in this [video](https://github.com/alexpopov1/autonomous-airship-GNC/blob/main/GNC%20Simulation.mp4).
